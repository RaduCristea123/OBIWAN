Guide to run the script

1. Install python 3.x (make sure to check the "Add Python to environment variables" box when installing)
2. Run setup.bat
3. Go to ..\obiwan-main\obiwan 
4. Edit config.yaml.sample with notepad
5. Change the following preset paths to the ones on your computer(!!!it must be the absolute path!!!):
			-scc_settings_file (it should look like this: ..\obiwan-main\obiwan\scc_settings_file)
			-scc_configuration_folder (it should look like this: ..\obiwan-main\obiwan\Samples)
			-system_netcdf_parameters (it should look like this: ..\atmospheric_lidar\systems\"intrument"\"instrument"_netcdf_parameters)
			-measurements_debug_dir (it should look like this: ..\debug_file ; found in the folder where the script was extracted)
			-TimeParameter.txt file (it should look like this: ..\obiwan-main\obiwan\TimeParameter.txt) 
6. Go to ..\obiwan-main\obiwan
7. Edit scc_access.config.yaml
8. Change the following:
		 	-output_dir: (absolute path to the SCC_Output file found where the script was extracted)
			-credentials for the SCC
9. Edit file.bat (found in ..\netcdf)
10. Change path after "--folder" to the path of the folder containing the measurements on your computer
11. Change path after "--cfg" to the config.yaml.sample file found in ..\obiwan-main\obiwan
12. Run run.bat (to start the script)

==================================================================

Customizable parameters

max_length -> maximum allowed time length for a set of measurements (value in seconds)
min_length -> minimum allowed time length for a set of measurements (value in seconds)
max_gap -> maximum allowed gap between continuous measurements (value in seconds)

center_type -> 3 values:
		-1   -> default value
		     -> does not center measurements
		     -> separates them in sets of "max_length" seconds
		 
		 0   -> measurement sets will be centered at XX:00
		     -> exceptions: first and last sets (depending on when the measuring started/stopped)
		     
		 1   -> measurement sets will be centered at XX:30
		     -> exceptions: first and last sets (depending on when the measuring started/stopped)
		     
test_lists -> set the number of different folders you want your tests to be stored in
	   -> after setting a number, list the names of the tests you want in each folder
	   
	   e.g. test_lists: 2
	   	test_list1: test_name_1, test_name_2, test_name_3
		test_list2: test_name_4, test_name_5
	All the files with the chosen names will be stored in the corresponding folder
	NOTE: The name of the file should be written at the location of the licel file header
	
==================================================================

IMPORTANT NOTES

In order for the script to recognize dark measurements, the location parameter must be "Dark"

Guide to run the script continuously
NOTE: Follow steps 1-11 from the first guide before doing this

!!!This only works for Windows!!!

1. Open Task Scheduler
2. On the right side, click on Create Task
3. General tab: Set a name for your task
4. Triggers tab: New -> Repeat task every: choose length based on desired max_length of the measurements sets 
					   (e.g. max_length = 1h -> Repeat task every 1h)
		 Other settings are optional, feel free to customize
5.Actions tab: New -> Programs/Script: Browse -> choose path to file.bat (found in ...\netcdf\file.bat)
	       Add arguments: "--continuous"
	       Start in: absolute path to the folder where the script was extracted
