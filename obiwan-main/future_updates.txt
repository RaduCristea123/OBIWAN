1. insert a Debug mode in on Cfg file like:
Debugging: on/off
Debuggign_output_dir: main_dir\lidar_easurements\output
  In debug mode the script should copy each one hour set in a different directory "YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm" and the associated Dark files to a subdirectory "D". 
  The created nc file should be copied in the "YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm" directory for each measurement
  This way the tester could check the files and conversion and could track any errors in the script and could use the script to structure the raw data in a proper and clear way 
  for further use 

      main_dir\lidar_easurements\YYYY-MM-DD-HH-00     measurements (location = "Atena")
                                 YYYY-MM-DD-HH-00\D   dark (location = "Dark")
                                 YYYY-MM-DD-HH-01     measurements (location = "Atena")
                                 YYYY-MM-DD-HH-01\D   dark (location = "Dark")
                                 ........

2. set the code to be used also for different ways to store the raw files
  A) the current one: all files in same directory. The Dark files should have "Dark" in the Location section in the header. The measurements should have the same location: e.g. for one hour 
  measurements all file should have the same name for the location "Bucharest" or "Athens" or "Cairo"
      main_dir\lidar_easurements
  
  B) Each measurement set (two or three or five hours set) is stored in a different folder ("YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm") while the Dark files are stored in 
  a subdirectory named "D" inside the main measurement directory
      main_dir\lidar_easurements\YYYY-MM-DD-HH-00     measurements (location = "Atena")
                                 YYYY-MM-DD-HH-00\D   dark (location = "Dark")
                                 YYYY-MM-DD-HH-01     measurements (location = "Atena")
                                 YYYY-MM-DD-HH-01\D   dark (location = "Dark")
                                 ........
      
  C) Each measurement set (two or three or five hours set) is stored in a different folder ("YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm") togather with the Dark files. The Dark files should have "Dark" in the Location section in the header. The measurements should have the same location: e.g. for one hour 
  measurements all file should have the same name for the location "Bucharest" or "Athens" or "Cairo"
      main_dir\lidar_easurements\YYYY-MM-DD-HH-00     measurements (location = "Atena") + dark (location = "Dark")
                                 YYYY-MM-DD-HH-01     measurements (location = "Atena") + dark (location = "Dark")
                                 YYYY-MM-DD-HH-02     measurements (location = "Atena") + dark (location = "Dark")
                                 ........
                               
3. Create an option in the cfg file to copy or move the files in the designated one hour directories (see opint 1)
File method (Copy or Move): Copy

4. Create a log file that keeps track of the processed files (converted and submitted). Create an option in the Cfg file to overwrite the processed files or skip them
Overright files: Yes/No
